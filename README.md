## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma

### What I learned

In this project, I used the Figma plugin for VS Code for the first time and got a chance to see how faster it allows me to work. It really is a great tool.

### Continued development

In this project, I need specialized date and time inputs that don't have accessibility issues. I haven't developed them yet but I want to dive deep into this topic and come up with one.
